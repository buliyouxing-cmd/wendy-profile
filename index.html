      Hi, my name is <strong>Wendy (Wanqi) Zhang</strong>, an aspiring journalist and communication professional currently studying 
      <strong>Communication Studies and Journalism at Emerson College</strong>. My experiences range from anchoring and scriptwriting for 
      WEBN General News and J-Channel Mandarin to leading marketing initiatives as Vice President of CSSA. I have also contributed 
      to documentary production at <strong>CCTV</strong> and gained international experience in digital media as a 
      <strong>V-Tuber operator on Bilibili</strong>, where I developed strategies that grew audiences by tens of thousands. 
      With a strong foundation in writing, reporting, and multimedia storytelling, I am passionate about delivering engaging news 
      content and building meaningful connections through media.
